# Xpress_LZ77Huffman
Microsoft Xpress : LZ77+Huffman Decompression Algorithm : Python3 implementation.

# Context
When attempting to read Windows 1.X prefetch files, windows uses a compression algorithm to encode the data.
This python script the implementation of the Xpress decompression algorithm used to encode those prefetch files.

The decompression algorithm is implemented into the "decompress_prefetch" function. Feel free to use it to decompress any other data using this compression method.

## Use case
The prefetch volatility3 plugin is using this algorithm: https://www.forensicxlab.com/posts/prefetch/
